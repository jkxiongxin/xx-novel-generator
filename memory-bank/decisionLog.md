[2025-06-03 16:51:00] - Created a new backend API endpoint /api/v1/workspace/{novel_id}/overview to address a 404 error. The frontend was attempting to access this endpoint, but it was not defined in the backend. The frontend should now be able to reach this endpoint. Further work is needed to populate it with actual data.
[2025-06-03 16:54:00] - Corrected a typo in `backend/app/api/v1/workspace.py`. Changed `deps.get_current_active_user` to `deps.get_current_user` to resolve an AttributeError that occurred after creating the workspace API.
